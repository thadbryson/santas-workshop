You will give us your first born child. It may be male or female. In the event of a multiple birth (twins, triplets, etc) you
must give us all of them. They will be our slaves. Slave is a harsh word but at our little Start Up we consider them a part of
the team.

Just the teammates we make do whatever we want. We used to have interns but laws have changed and we found slaves to be a
suitable replacment.

They will perform the following privileges:

1. Get us coffee.
2. Attend all company functions. Picnics, cookouts, lunches, and everything else.
3. Whatever they produce belongs to us.
4. We have special holding cells for the slaves. Some lesser beings not involved in our culture call them cubicles.
5. Dart target practice.
